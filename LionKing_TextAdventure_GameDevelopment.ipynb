    "#### Lion King Hangman, Lion King T/F Quiz and Lion King Quiz are all games based on the beloved Disney classic, Lion King. These three stages of games are an excellent way for fans of the Lion King movie to test and improve their knowledge about the characters and events of the movie, and also to have fun. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### In all three games, the player's score is displayed at the end and the player may have the option to play again if they do not reach the goal score of 30 points or pass the final quiz. Each stage of the game must be passed by reaching a score of 30 points, if the player fails to reach the goal score, they will have the option to retry the stage. This allows players to keep trying until they successfully pass the stage and advance to the next one.\n",

    "#### In Lion King Hangman, players are given descriptions of characters from the movie as a hint and must guess the names of the characters by either guessing letters or the full name. If a letter is correctly guessed, it will be revealed in the character's name and if the full name is correctly guessed, the player earns 10 points. The game continues with different characters until the player reaches a certain number of points or runs out of turns. \n",
